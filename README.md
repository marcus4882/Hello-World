# Hello-World
This is my First Experience with GitHub
I am studing Programming at Strayer University but decided to do Data Science course at JOhn Hopinks Univerisity.
Very happy with the course  and my interest in Data is developing after i completed a course in Databases.
I make this change just a part of my studies for Github.
